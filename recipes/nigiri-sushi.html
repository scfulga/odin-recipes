            <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
        <p><strong>Nigirizushi</strong>, or <strong>nigiri</strong>, is a type of sushi consisting of an oblong ball of sushi rice typically topped with a little wasabi and a slice of raw fish. The rice can also be topped with cooked ingredients like cooked shrimp or tamagoyaki and garnishes like scallions. Its name comes from the verb “nigiru,” which means to clench or clasp in the hand. Making perfectly shaped nigiri by hand takes practice and skill.</p>

            <h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups Japanese short-grain <strong>white rice</strong></li>
            
            <li>2-inch piece <strong>kombu</strong> (optional) </li>
            
            <li>⅓<strong> cup rice vinegar</strong>, plus more for shaping </li>
            
            <li>3 tablespoons <strong>sugar</strong> </li>
            
            <li>1½ teaspoon <strong>kosher or sea salt</strong></li>
            
            <li>30 slices <strong>sushi-grade raw fish and/or tamagoyaki</strong></li>
            
            <li><strong>Wasabi paste</strong> (optional) </li>
        </ul>

            <h2><u>Steps</u></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the sushi rice. In a large bowl, use your fingers to wash the rice with cold water until the water is almost clear, changing the water frequently (about 4–8 times). Soak the clean rice in fresh cold water for 30 minutes. Drain the rice in a fine-mesh sieve. </li>
            
            <li>Cook the rice on the stovetop or in an electric rice cooker with the kombu. If cooking on the stovetop, combine the rice and 2 cups of water in a medium pot over medium heat. Cover and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cook until the water is completely absorbed—about 12 minutes. If using a rice cooker, use the “sushi” setting if available and the amount of water indicated for three cups of rice. </li>
            
            <li>In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar, sugar, and salt over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and whisk until the sugar dissolves. </li>
            
            <li>Wet the inside of a large bowl with a damp cloth and transfer the cooked rice to the slightly wet bowl, leaving behind any rice that’s stuck to the bottom of the pot. Pour the hot vinegar mixture over the rice. Use a wooden spoon or plastic rice paddle to slice through the rice at a 45-degree angle, flipping the rice over in between strokes. </li>
            
            <li>Once the rice is completely mixed, cover the bowl with a clean, damp kitchen towel until ready to use. You want warm rice when making sushi. </li>
            
            <li>Prepare a small bowl of ice water with a splash of rice vinegar. </li>
            
            <li>Dip your hands into the water and use your damp hands to grab a small ball of sushi rice. </li>
            
            <li>Using your hands, form the rice into a rectangle about as long as one slice of fish. </li>
            
            <li>Using a chopstick, place a small dab of wasabi paste on the center of the rice. </li>
            
            <li>Top the rice ball with a slice of fish and gently squeeze the rice and fish together in one hand, using the index finger of your other hand to keep the fish in place. </li>
            <li>Repeat steps 7–10 with the remaining fish and rice. </li>
        </ol>
